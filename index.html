        <p> Then stop. Save your energy for something else. The Law <br>
            of Attraction is a real thing; if you hold bad energy, you'll <br>
            receive it in return.  Besides, why hate on someone specifically<br>
             when you can just hate on everyone? Might as well be <br>

        <p> It's time to put an end to those boring, dreadful introductions. <br>
             Nobody wants to talk about their quarantine.
            Especially those <br>
            who <i>gained a few</i> during the quarantine. SO LET'S STOP WITH <br>
            THOSE TERRIBLE INTRODUCTIONS! Rather, let's introduce <br>
             each other with startling riddles. Instead of "How was your <br>
             quarantine?" how about... "I speak without a mouth and hear <br>
              without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. What <br>
              am I?" That'll have them stumbling.... <br>

        <h1>Drinking out of bottles... Lame!</h1>
    </div>
        <p>We all know that plastic water bottles are terrible for the environment. Reusable water bottles are cool. But you know what's even better? Reusable <b>SPRAY</b> bottles. Something better than drinking out of a boring bottle, is being <b>SPRAYED</b> directly in your mouth. An amazing disperse of water molecules hits the back of your throat. It properly cleans your mouth, unlike the typical water bottle. <Br>
