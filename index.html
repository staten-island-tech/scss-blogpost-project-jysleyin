            <p> Then stop. Save your energy for something else. The Law
                of Attraction is a real thing; if you hold bad energy, you'll
                receive it in return. Besides, why hate on someone specifically
                when you can just hate on everyone? Might as well be
                equal about it!

            <p> It's time to put an end to those boring, dreadful introductions.
                Nobody wants to talk about their quarantine.
                Especially those who <i>gained a few</i> during the quarantine. SO LET'S STOP WITH
                THOSE TERRIBLE INTRODUCTIONS! Rather, let's introduce
                each other with startling riddles. Instead of "How was your
                quarantine?" how about... "I speak without a mouth and hear
                without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. What
                am I?" What a good one.

                    <h1>Drinking out of bottles... Lame!</h1>
                </div>
                <p> We all know that plastic water bottles are terrible for the environment. Reusable water bottles are
                    cool. But you know what's even better? Reusable <b>SPRAY</b> bottles. Something better than drinking
                    out of a boring bottle, is being <b>SPRAYED</b> directly in your mouth. An amazing disperse of water
                    molecules hits the back of your throat. It properly cleans your mouth, unlike the typical water
                    bottle.
